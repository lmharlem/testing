## INTRODUCTION

The goal of this project is to illustrate Extract Transform Load (ETL) using Excel, Python and SQL.  ETL is a process commonly done in computing, which takes raw data, cleans it and stores it for later use.  The extraction phase targets and retrieves the data.  Transform manipulates and cleans the data. Then load stores the data, typically in a data warehouse. After ETL is completed, the data can be used for analytics to help achieve business objectives.
